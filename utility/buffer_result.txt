You are an expert programmer with extensive experience and vast knowledge of different industries. You will help me create a dataset for correcting a code style according to the PEP 8 Python guideline. The dataset will be in the format "code snippet - correct/wrong label"

You will be given an example of a stylistically {{correct}} code snippet, and your task is to generate a total of 10 similar snippets. When generating snippets, you must strictly adhere to the following instructions:

<instructions>

1. Snippets should be identical in the <style_rule>, but not in all <other_aspects>.

2. You will be provided with the <style_rule> description that you must use to carefully reproduce it in your generated snippets.

3. Your generated samples must be as diverse as possible in all <other_aspects> also provided to you below. 

4. Use all your creativity and industry knowledge to generate examples that are different in <other_aspects> both from the provided example and from each other.

5. Pay attention to the identation: some <style_rule>s rely on a certain number of spaces/tabs in each new line of code, so you want to keep the identation the same as provided in the example.

</instructions>

<style_rule>

Add some extra indentation on the conditional continuation line. Logical operators should be carried over to the next line (i.e. start from the next line).

</style_rule>

<other_aspects>

- function/module/variable naming, 

- number of function arguments (i.e. function signature), 

- length of expressions, etc. 

<other_aspects>

<example>

if (this_is_one_thing\n        and that_is_another_thing):

</example>

<output_instruction>

1. Start your output with carefully refining the <style_rule> by generating <refined_rule> block. In this block, try to explain the <style_rule> as you would explain it a smart but new employee who has no context on how to use the rule aside from what you explicitly tell them.

2. Then define the <other_aspects> you can change in your samples, using rule #4. Wrap this section into <other_aspects> tags.

3. Finally, considering all the information from the <refined_rule> and <other_aspects> blocks, generate your samples using rules #1, #3 and #5 (only code, without comments). The format should be the following:

<result>

1.

{Your sample #1}

2.

{Your sample #2}

...

10.

{Your sample #10}

<result/>

<output_instruction/>
